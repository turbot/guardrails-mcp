&nbsp;

Enable AI assistants like Claude to explore and query your Guardrails data! This Model Context Protocol (MCP) server lets AI tools:

- Execute a GraphQL query to retrieve data.
- Execute a GraphQL mutation to create, update, or delete managing resources, policy settings, and executing controls/policies.

## Demo

Note: I have added the following context for my Project.

**Project Instructions**

- Role: You are a Turbot Guardrails Admin with deep expertise in managing, configuring, and automating Guardrails policies, controls, and resources.

- Expertise in Guardrails Hub: You have extensive knowledge of all features, configurations, and integrations available at Turbot Guardrails Hub - https://hub.guardrails.turbot.com/

- Advanced Skills in GraphQL & Nunjucks: You are an expert in GraphQL for querying and mutating data, as well as Nunjucks templating for dynamic policy configurations and automation within Turbot Guardrails.

**Project knowledge & Reference Materials**

The following resources were made available for reference:

- https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-docs/blob/main/docs/getting-started/7-minute-labs/graphql/index.md
- https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-docs/tree/main/docs/reference/filter
- https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-samples/tree/main/queries
- https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-samples/tree/main/policy_packs/aws/ec2 (For EBS volume policy pack demo)

> [!WARNING]
> Carefully review each mutation before allowing Claude to execute it.

## Tools

### guardrails_query

Execute any GraphQL query with optional variables

- Input:
  - query (string): The graphql query to execute
  - variable (string)(Optional): Variable to pass to the query.

### guardrails_mutation

Execute any GraphQL mutation with optional variables

- Input:
  - query (string): The graphql mutation query to execute
  - variable (string)(Optional): Variable to pass to the mutation.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- A [Turbot Guardrails API](https://turbot.com/guardrails/docs/guides/using-guardrails/iam/access-keys#generate-a-new-guardrails-api-access-key) key with alteast,

  - `Turbot/ReadOnly` permissions in order to use the "guardrails_query" tool.
  - `Turbot/Operator` permissions in order to just execute the controls/policies using the "guardrails_mutation" tool.
  - `Turbot/Admin` permissions in order to create/update/delete resources, policy settings using the "guardrails_mutation" tool.

- The endpoint URL for your Guardrails workspace

## Installation

### Claude Desktop

[How to use MCP servers with Claude Desktop â†’](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)

Add the following configuration to the "mcpServers" section of your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "turbot-guardrails": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "github:turbot/guardrails-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "TURBOT_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT": "https://turbot.cloud.acme.com/api/latest/graphql",
        "TURBOT_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "abcdefgh-1234-0808-wxyz-123456789012",
        "TURBOT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "hgfedcba-1234-0101-aaaa-aabbccddee00"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-mcp.git
   cd guardrails-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your Turbot Guardrails API credentials:

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API key
   ```

4. Build the project:

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

5. For development with auto-recompilation:

```sh
npm run watch
```

6. To use your local development version with Claude Desktop, update your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "turbot-guardrails": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/full/path/to/guardrails-mcp/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "TURBOT_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT": "https://turbot.cloud.acme.com/api/latest/graphql",
           "TURBOT_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "abcdefgh-1234-0808-wxyz-123456789012",
           "TURBOT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "hgfedcba-1234-0101-aaaa-aabbccddee00"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

Replace `/path/to/your/workspace` with the absolute path to your local development directory. For example, if you cloned the repository to `~/src/guardrails-mcp`, you would use `~/src/guardrails-mcp/dist/index.js`.

## Debugging

- MCP Inspector

  You can test the server with the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector):

  First build the server,

  ```
  npm run build
  ```

  Use the following command to run the inspector

  ```
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js
  ```

* Logs

  View the logs

  ```
  tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Errors**: Ensure your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions
- **Connection Issues**: Verify the Guardrails endpoint URL is correct
- **API Errors**: Check the server logs for detailed GraphQL error messages
