<!-- <img src="https://badge.mcpx.dev?type=server&features=tools" title="MCP server with features/>&nbsp; -->

Enable AI assistants like Claude to explore, analyze, and interact with your Guardrails data! This Model Context Protocol (MCP) server provides powerful capabilities:

- Query and analyze cloud resources using GraphQL
- List and filter available resource types, control types, and policy types
- Execute controls to assess cloud resource compliance
- Explore GraphQL schemas for custom queries
- Process templates using Nunjucks for dynamic configurations

## Demo

  - `Turbot/ReadOnly` permissions in order to use the "query_guardrails" tool and list tools.
  - `Turbot/Operator` permissions in order to execute controls using the "run_control" tool.

- The endpoint URL for your Guardrails workspace

## Installation

### Claude Desktop

[How to use MCP servers with Claude Desktop â†’](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/user)

Add the following configuration to the "mcpServers" section of your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "turbot-guardrails": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "github:turbot/guardrails-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "TURBOT_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT": "https://turbot.cloud.acme.com/api/latest/graphql",
        "TURBOT_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "abcdefgh-1234-0808-wxyz-123456789012",
        "TURBOT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "hgfedcba-1234-0101-aaaa-aabbccddee00"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Local Development

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the directory:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/turbot/guardrails-mcp.git
   cd guardrails-mcp
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your Turbot Guardrails API credentials:

   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your API key
   ```

4. Build the project:

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

5. For development with auto-recompilation:

```sh
npm run watch
```

6. To use your local development version with Claude Desktop, update your `claude_desktop_config.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "turbot-guardrails": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/full/path/to/guardrails-mcp/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "TURBOT_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT": "https://turbot.cloud.acme.com/api/latest/graphql",
           "TURBOT_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "abcdefgh-1234-0808-wxyz-123456789012",
           "TURBOT_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "hgfedcba-1234-0101-aaaa-aabbccddee00"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

Replace `/path/to/your/workspace` with the absolute path to your local development directory. For example, if you cloned the repository to `~/src/guardrails-mcp`, you would use `~/src/guardrails-mcp/dist/index.js`.

## Debugging

- MCP Inspector

  You can test the server with the [MCP Inspector](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/tools/inspector):

  First build the server,

  ```
  npm run build
  ```

  Use the following command to run the inspector

  ```
  npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector node dist/index.js
  ```

* Logs

  View the logs

  ```
  tail -n 20 -f ~/Library/Logs/Claude/mcp*.log
  ```

## Troubleshooting

- **Authentication Errors**: Ensure your API key is correct and has the necessary permissions
- **Connection Issues**: Verify the Guardrails endpoint URL is correct
- **API Errors**: Check the server logs for detailed GraphQL error messages
